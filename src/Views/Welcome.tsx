                        I am currently a computer science student at ENSEEIHT in
                        Toulouse, a prestigious engineering school specializing
                        in sciences and technology. My academic journey began in
                        the MPSI preparatory program (Mathematics, Physics, and
                        Engineering Sciences), which provided me with a solid
                        theoretical foundation. I then continued my studies at
                        the Blagnac IUT, where I specialized in computer science
                        and deepened my knowledge in programming, databases, and
                        software development.

                        Since my second year at IUT, I have been working as a
                        Software Engineering Apprentice at Collins Aerospace in
                        Blagnac. Within this international company, I focused on
                        developing tools for the technical teams and integrating
                        DevSecOps practices to enhance the security and
                        efficiency of the development processes. This experience
                        allowed me to gain an in-depth understanding of the
                        technical challenges faced by high-tech companies and
                        apply the knowledge acquired during my studies.

                        Outside of my academic and professional experience, my
                        interests include football, video games, photography,
                        and home automation. I am an avid football fan and enjoy
                        both watching matches and playing the sport. Photography
                        is another passion of mine, where I enjoy capturing
                        moments and experimenting with different techniques.
                        Additionally, I am fascinated by automation and home
                        technologies, particularly in the context of smart homes
                        and devices that make everyday life more efficient and
                        convenient.
